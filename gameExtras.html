    </div>
    <h6>Usually, the different alien races in the galaxy don't get along too well. They might not engage in outright war, but they don't invite each other over for dinner, either.
    <br><br>However, when a menace threatens everyone equally, they'll quickly band together to fight it. The Xenos on PK-L7 certainly count as one of those menaces.
    <br><br>The Survivors of the Galaxy box set for Zombicide: Invader introduces four new Survivors that players can choose for their games. Each one comes with its own dashboard and unique set of abilities to help them in the dark corridors and bombed-out buildings on the planet.
    <br><br>They'll need all those skills, too, as the strangely-named Babyface Abomination also lurks those corridors, looking to eviscerate anyone that gets in its way.

    <div>
    <h6>The Zombicide: Invader ï¿½ Deck Holder Set includes four deck holders made out of durable plastic, separated into two different colors.
      <br><br>The construction of the deck holders allows them to hold either 190 unsleeved cards, or up to 105 sleeved cards.
      <br><br>Standing at 6cm tall, they're easy to draw from and will keep your cards sequestered during the game.
      <br><br>The set is enough to hold both your draw and discard piles for both your Equipment and Xeno decks.

    </div>
    <div>
      <h6>PK-L7 is a large planet, with many different mining operations dotted across its surface. Some of these complexes grew to be huge, sprawling many miles.
      <br><br>When the Xenos started attacking, none of these bases were safe from the rampaging hordes.
      <br><br>With Survivors spread all over the planet and resources stretched thin, is there any hope that anyone will make it off the surface alive?
      <br><br>The Zombicide: Invader Tiles Set gives players new options when creating custom scenarios.
      <br><br>It has the nine double-sided tiles from the Zombicide: Invader core box, as well as the three double-sided tiles from the Black Ops expansion.
      <br><br>These twelve tiles can allow players to create truly epic scenarios or use both sides of a particular tile when creating missions.

    <h4>Zombicide Invader:<br> 3D Doors <br> $26.99</h4>
    <img src="Images/doors3DNoBG.png" alt="Doors" style="width:250px;">
    </div>
    <div>
      <h6>
        11 3D Plastic Doors to bring a new dimension to your game!
        <br><br>This includes 5 generic grey doors, and 6 other mission-specific colored doors in pink, white, blue, purple, green, and yellow.
        Doors in Zombicide: Invader are not handled the same way as in previous Zombicide games. Since it is your base that's being invaded, initially all doors are open (unless otherwise required by a mission), which means there are no door tokens on the board, only openings on the tiles.
        Survivors can decide to close a door next to them, placing a Closed Door on an opening. They can also open them again by simply removing the Closed Door. However, when Xenos try to move past a Closed Door, they bust it open and it becomes a Destroyed Door. Such doors are permanently open and cannot be closed again.
        Taking these rules into account, the 3D Plastic Doors have two modes: Closed and Destroyed.
        <br><br>When a Closed Door is Destroyed, simply swivel down the door pane so it's lying flat on the ground!
